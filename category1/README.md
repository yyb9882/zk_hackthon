## Overview
This is a SHA256 circuit instantiation for zk hackthon. Our team uses circom to instantiate the entire SHA256 hash function.
The structure of our project is described as follows:
1. `sha256.circom`: Main function for sha256 circuit, including padding and SHA256 compression function.
2. `gadgets.circom`: All subcircuits used in SHA256 compression function, some of the instantiations in `gadgets.circom` come from [here](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/tree/master/circuits/sha256).
3. `constants.circom`: Constants k and H used in SHA256 compression function.
4. `test/circuits/SHA256_1.circom`: Test for the correctness of SHA256('abc').
5. `test/circuits/SHA256_2.circom`: Test for the correctness of SHA256('abcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabcabc').
  
For more details about our project, we refer to you our [demonstration](https://youtu.be/jMvADEYE8Zs).

## Installation
1. Install `circom` following this [installation guide](https://docs.circom.io/getting-started/installation/). Once installed, ensure that you're using the correct version of `circom` by running `circom --version`. You should see `circom compiler 2.1.4` or later.
2. Install the `mocha test runner`: run `npm install -g mocha`.
3. Run `mocha test` and verify that most of the tests fail, but not because of missing dependencies.

## Build
With the number of chunks in SHA256 hash function increases, 
To print the number of R1CS constraints, run the following commands:
```sh
circom test/circuits/SHA256_1.circom --r1cs
circom test/circuits/SHA256_2.circom --r1cs
```
It is obvious that the number of R1CS constraints of the entire SHA256 hash function is linear to the number of chunks.
This is because the number of times to execute the SHA256 compression function is equal to the number of chunks.

## Verify the Correctness of SHA256 Circuit
You can run both of the tests with the command:
```sh
mocha test --timeout 10000
```
or, you can run one of the two tests with the command:
```sh
mocha test/SHA256_1 --timeout 10000
mocha test/SHA256_2 --timeout 10000
```

## SHA256 Workflow
Template `sha256(l)` in `category1/SHA256.circom` is the main function for the entire SHA256 hash function (including padding and SHA256 compression function).
The workflow of SHA256 hash function is as follows:
  
1. Represent the message as binary string. (For a sake of time limitation, we do not consider message representation. Instead, the input message should be binary strings)
2. Padding the binary string(template `padding(l)` in `category1/SHA256.circom`) 
3. Split the padded binary string into several chunks, each chunk consists of 512 bits.
4. For each chunk, run a SHA256 compression function(template `sha256_compression` in `category1/SHA256.circom`).
5. Output the final state as the output of SHA256 hash function.
  
The total number of R1CS constraints is linear to the number of times to execute the SHA256 compression function.

## SHA256 Subcomputation
All the implementation of subcomputation (subcircuits) are implemented in `category1/gadgets.circom`,
most subcomputations are based on bit operations and we introduce it as follows:
### bitAND, bitXOR, bitNOT
It is unnecessary to verify every input lies in the binary field (0 or 1), which significantly reduce the number of R1CS constraints.
All bits will be checked in some intermediate rounds and in the final round.
### SmallSigma, BigSigma
$$SmallSigma(ra, rb, rc)\ =\ RightRotate(a, ra)\oplus{RightRotate(b, rb)}\oplus{RightShift(c, rc)}$$ 
  
$$BigSigma(ra, rb, rc)\ =\ RightRotate(a, ra)\oplus{RightRotate(b, rb)}\oplus{RightRotate(c, rc)}$$ 
We use the same implementation of these two subcomputations in [here](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/sha256/sigma.circom).
### Maj, Ch
$$maj(a,b,c) = (a\ and\ b) \oplus (a\ and\ c) \oplus (b\ and\ c)$$
  
$$ch(e,f,g) = (e\ and\ f) \oplus ((not\ e)\ and\ g)$$
We use the same implementation of maj operation in [here](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/sha256/maj.circom) and ch operation in [here](https://github.com/iden3/circomlib/blob/master/circuits/sha256/ch.circom).
### bitADD
bitADD operation is used to add two binary strings and then modulo $2^{32}$. The highest bit is not needed if it exceeds $2^{32}$.
With the same reason as mentioned in bitAND operations, most intermediate bits need not be checked in order to reduce the number of R1CS constraints.


## Comparison
We compare the number of R1CS constraints for the state-of-the-art work:
| Example | Description | Number of constraints |
| ----- | --- | --- |
| xjsnark [SHA-256 (Unpadded)](https://github.com/akosba/xjsnark/tree/master/doc/code_previews/README.md#sha-256-unpadded) |  High-level implementation of SHA-256 which is compiled to an optimized circuit similar to the one produced by manual/low-level libraries, as in [jsnark](https://github.com/akosba/jsnark). One round compression| 25538 | 
| [Ours (1 round compression)] [here](https://github.com/yyb9882/zk_hackthon/blob/main/category1/test/circuits/SHA256_1.circom) | One chunk (only need 1 round compression) | 21488 |
| [Ours (2 rounds compression)] [here](https://github.com/yyb9882/zk_hackthon/blob/main/category1/test/circuits/SHA256_2.circom) | Two chunks (needs 2 round compression) | 42976
